Proof and screenshots of program below.

This program is operated by a while loop in main, which prompts the user for input on which actions they want to see happen in the terminal.

A series of choices is provided to the user -- which categorization of employee, the name of the employee, and the hours said employee has worked.
Once everything is inputted the functions for each subclass do their own computations. The employee is then added to a vector for employees, the overarching 
class then accommodates for individual instances.

Example of the program in action is below.

I quit after two runthroughs which highlight professional vs nonprofessional, but the user can keep on adding 
employees to an imaginary company until their hearts desires, the vector and print will still be valid. Once done adding,
type Q when prompted in the menu. The desired values are asked to the user before input.
