Screenshots & proof are provided in this readme. 

This program is run by the main program. 

From here, you will press run/ debug, or however your program prompts you to start.

This is defined by a series of  tests, enter correct values into the terminal and everything flows seemlessly. ![Screenshot (912)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91101801/196582565-ea094253-afb2-4679-ae45-8e162d183ae1.png)

However, this program does have a lot of try/except blocks, so entering an index not within the size of the array or entering a letter/string value will not cause the program to crash. example below. ![Screenshot (913)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91101801/196583013-333e5557-c986-4879-972e-1670fa05994d.png)

Any mix/match of correct/incorrect values won't cause the program to mess up. It goes by a function-by-function basis so a failure in one won't translate over. The program will not prompt a start over nor is it in a loop so an alteration of the main will have tobe programmed in.
