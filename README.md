# CS303, awy9n@umsystem.edu

Proof and screenshots of program below.

This program doesn't have a lot of user involvement, but it operates off of main and the user will input values in the console.

The program will prompt for the user to enter a singular string  to check if its a palindrome, 
upon entering it, the user will get a message if what they entered is or isn't a palindrome. 

After that, the program will output the states and capitals, then ask which state the user wants to find.
If the user has correctly entered a state, then the program will return what the capital is.
If the user entered a state that isn't on the list, then the program will give an error message.

The final part of the assignment doesn't have anything for the user to modify, it just fills in a queue 
with values and then modifies the order. However, the values can be altered by switching the values around in the 
loop to be a different (positive) integer value or by pushing a value on after the loop has executed. 

I have included two screenshots below, one is with a string that isn't a palindrome but a correct state.
The other is with a palindrome but an incorrect state. In both instances, the modification of the queue is correct.

Both repl and VSCode were used, which is why there are descrepancies in the styles.
